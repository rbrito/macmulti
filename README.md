# macmulti

This repository consists of exercises taken from the educational site [Projeto MAC Multim√≠dia][0].
I am putting some solutions here that I would expect from high school/1st year undergrads that
were just learning how to program, which is why I refrained from making them elegant or efficient
(see, e.g., the primality test being the dumbest ever).

The programs are written in Scala (so far), but I may add solutions in other languages, as time
permits.

## Note about the style

I am *deliberately* not programming these in a functional manner. I may use a functional style later,
but the main idea right now is to convey programming mutability and how machines work to said students.
